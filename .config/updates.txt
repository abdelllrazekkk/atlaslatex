This new version contains a number ofupdates:
The October 2020 LaTeX update led to options being ignored when passed to a document class or a style file if the filename contained a directory.
Hence a new style file `atlaslatexpath.sty` has been introduced and should be loaded using

- New style file atlaslatexpath.sty to set search path for style files and document class.
- New script atlaslatex_2020.sh to make adjustments to main files for TeX Live 2020.
- The macro \ATLASLATEXPATH should no longer be necessary or be used.
- Block option was being ignored in atlasbiblatex.sty as of version 07-01-00.
