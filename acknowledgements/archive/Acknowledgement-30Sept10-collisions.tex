\section{Acknowledgements}

We deeply thank everybody at CERN involved in operating the LHC in such a superb way during this initial high-energy data-taking period. We acknowledge equally warmly all the technical and administrative staff in the collaborating institutions without whom ATLAS could not be operated so efficiently.
