This new version contains a number of updates:
- Update publications up to June 2022.
- Use report (scrreprt) class for notes. Pass option REPORT=false to use old default of scrartcl.
- Change syntax of ToDo note commands so text associated with note is now an optional rather than required parameter.
- The macro \ATLASLATEXPATH should no longer be necessary or be used.
