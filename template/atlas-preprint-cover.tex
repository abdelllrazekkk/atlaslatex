\PreprintCoverAbstract{This is a test of how a cover for the ATLAS-CERN preprints can be produced as standalone document. The idea is that it should be included before the paper in the journal format. With this, there is no need for CDS to stamp the CERN logo and preprint number and risk an overlapping with the title and/or other information.
